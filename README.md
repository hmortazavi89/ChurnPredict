ChurnPredict
Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains a Machine Learning project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using a Random Forest Classifier. The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Project Overview

Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn based on features like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and internet service.
Dataset: Synthetic telecom dataset (telecom_churn.csv) with customer information.
Model: Random Forest Classifier, achieving an AUC-ROC score above 0.75.
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.


Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChurnPredict.git


Install dependencies:pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy


Run the Python script:python customer_churn_prediction.py



Results

Achieved an AUC-ROC score above 0.75, indicating strong model performance.
Identified key features (tenure, contract type) driving churn predictions.
Visualized feature importance and ROC curves for actionable insights.

Future Work

Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost.
Add more features from external datasets.
Deploy the model as a web app for real-time predictions.
